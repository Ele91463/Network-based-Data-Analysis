To carry out this project, I will begin by selecting a real dataset of my choice from GEO, on which I’ll apply multivariate analysis and machine learning techniques to analyze biological data. The project will cover high-throughput biological data types, biological databases, and network-based analysis, using examples from real case studies. I’ll also explore various approaches to graphics and visualization, with a focus on effectively communicating high-dimensional data. I’ll use R, Bioconductor, and/or Cytoscape
